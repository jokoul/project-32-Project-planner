# project-32-Project-planner

## Description

This app is a project planner which allows to plan and manage new project. I use Json Server to simulate an API in my app. I implement CRUD operations and I use router-link to manage navigation. Custom events made with $emit,props, methods,data properties and computed data help me to set the logic of my app.
